The goal of MetadataApp is to enable better content management. The app let's users create a batch file that will record metadata. After running the file, users can upload the results to get a tabular csv and visualise the output using the built-in functionalities of the app.

## Installation

The metadata app is currently not available for download.
## Example

Example for this app will be provided upon request from the author.

Currently the only place to access this app is on shinyapps.io (and directly from the public GitHub repository).
