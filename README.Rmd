# MetadataApp

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MetadataApp is to enable better content management. The app lets users create a batch file that will record metadata. After running the script (or their own dir script), users can upload the text file to get a tabular csv and visualise the output using the built-in functionalities of the app.

## Installation

The metadata app is available from through GitHub (github.com/zackbk/metadata).

Currently the only place to access this app is on shinyapps.io (and directly from the public GitHub repository).
