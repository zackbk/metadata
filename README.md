# MetadataApp

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MetadataApp is to enable better content management. The app
letâ€™s users create a batch file that will record metadata. After running
the file, users can upload the results to get a tabular csv and
visualise the output using the built-in functionalities of the app.

## Installation

The metadata app is currently not available for download.

Currently the only place to access this app is on shinyapps.io (and
directly from the public GitHub repository).
